CONTROLS (MORE DETAILED INFO UNDER "USAGE" BELOW)
--------------------------------------------------------------

---- Controller 1 ----

Select - changes position of movie
Start - toggles color cycling
Up, Down, Left, Right - toggles movie scrolling in given direction
B - changes palette
A - reverses direction of movie

---- Controller 2 ----

Up, Down - change animation speed

--------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, you're going to need a CHR (character graphics bank)
file properly prepped for this software. Check the accompanying PDF
that explains this process. Big up Batsly Adams for the tutorial and
converter.

However, if you're lazy, there is an included GIF and proper CHR files
for both MMC3 and MMC5. You'll want MMC3 if you're using a PowerPak,
but MMC5 will allow for larger files - and is well suited for emulation.

In the INCLUDED FILES section about you can see there are batch files
(for Windows) and shell scripts (for OSX) to compile both versions.
Both of these use asm6 to compile, so big thanks to the one like loopy.

After you have your ROM ready to go, the fun begins. This ROM uses
both controllers, as outlined in CONTROLS above. By default, the
movie plays in four-up mode. You can hit SELECT to change the position
of the movie, from four-up, to upper left, upper right, lower left,
lower right, or center. UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT will toggle the
screen scrolling in those directions. You can position the movie using
these controls, or just keep it scrolling. B changes through a preset
number of palettes. You can edit these near the end of the source code.
START toggles color cycling of the selected palette. A reverses the
playback direction of the movie. Tap it repeatedly to make it go back
and forth. On controller two you can hit UP and DOWN to change the
speed of the animation.
